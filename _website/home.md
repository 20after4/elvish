      <h2>Powerful Pipelines</h2>
      <p>
        Text pipelines are intuitive and powerful. However, if your data have
        inherently complex structures, passing them through the pipeline
        often requires a lot of ad-hoc, hard-to-maintain text processing code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pipelines in Elvish can carry structured data, not just text. You can
        stream lists, maps and even functions through the pipeline.

      <h2>Intuitive Control Structures</h2>
      <p>
        If you know programming, you probably already know how
        <code>if</code> looks in C. So why learn another syntax?
      </p>
      <p>
        Control structures in Elvish have an intuitive C-like syntax.

      <h2>Directory History</h2>
      <p>
        Is <code>cd /a/long/nested/directory</code> the first thing you
        do every day? Struggling to remember where your logs and
        configurations?
      </p>
      <p>
        Elvish remembers where you have been. Press Ctrl-L and search, like in a
        browser.

      <h2>Command History</h2>
      <p>
        Want to find the magical <code>ffmpeg</code> command that you used to
        transcode a video file two months ago?
      </p>
      <p>
        Just dig through your command history with Ctrl-R. Same key, more
        useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        (To be fair, you can do this in bash with <code>history | grep
        ffmpeg</code>, but it's far fewer keystrokes in Elvish :)

        Power of the shell or convenience of a file manager?
      </p>

        Choose both. Press Ctrl-N to quickly navigate directories and preview
        files, with full shell power.
