The [website](https://elv.sh) has everything else: downloads, announcements, guides, etc.. Here are some simple steps of becoming a master Elf:

1. [Download](https://elv.sh/download/) a binary for your platform.

2. Get started with examples in the [cookbook](https://elv.sh/learn/cookbook.html).

3. Read [the reference section](https://elv.sh/ref/) to understand Elvish as a programming language; in particular, read the [language reference](https://elv.sh/ref/language.html) and the [builtin module reference](https://elv.sh/ref/builtin.html).

4. Get familiar with how to write [Effective Elvish](https://elv.sh/learn/effective-elvish.html). This is a living document that evolves with the Elvish language itself.


## Name

In [roguelikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike), items made by the elves have a reputation of high quality. These are usually called *elven* items, but I chose "elvish" because it ends with "sh", a long tradition of Unix shells. It also rhymes with [fish](https://fishshell.com), one of the shells that influenced the philosophy of Elvish.

The word "Elvish" should be capitalized like a proper noun. However, when referring to the `elvish` command, use it in lower case with fixed-width font.

Whoever practices the Elvish way by either contributing to it or simply using it is called an **Elf**. (You might have guessed this from the name of the GitHub organization.) The official adjective for Elvish (as in "Pythonic" for Python, "Rubyesque" for Ruby) is **Elven**.
