das, an experimental Unix shell
===============================

This is a work in progress. Things may change and/or break without notice. You
have been warned...

Building
--------

You need go >= 1.1 to build this. Just run `make`. The resulting binary is
called `das`.

Name
----

Indeed, *das* is not a very good name for a Unix shell. The name is actually a
corrupted form of *dash*, which also happens to be the German definite neuter
article.

I have some other ideas in mind. One of them is *elv*, since I found elvish to
be a great adjective - I can't use "elf" though, since it's already
[taken](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/elf.html) and may be confused with the
well known [file
format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format).

Another possible source of names is the names of actual seashells; but my
English vocabulary is too small for me to recall any beyond "nautilus", which
is both too long and already taken.

I'm not avoiding names ending in "sh" though; but I do find "bash" to be a
terrible name. "fish" is clever, but it has a quite unpleasant adjective.
