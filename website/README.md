This directory contains source for Elvish's official website. It is the source
of a static website. To generate the website you need the following tools.

*   pandoc 2.2.1 (other versions in the 2.x series might also work).

*   [genblog](https://github.com/xiaq/genblog).

*   A Go toolchain.

These files used to live in a [separate
repository](https://github.com/elves/elvish.io). However, because @xiaq did
not merge the repositories in the correct way (he simply copied all the
files), the commit history is lost. Please see that repository for a full list
of contributors.
